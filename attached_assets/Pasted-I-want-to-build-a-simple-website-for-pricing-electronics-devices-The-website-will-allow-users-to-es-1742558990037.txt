I want to build a simple website for pricing electronics devices. The website will allow users to estimate the price of their device based on its specifications and photos. Here are the requirements:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Users can enter details about their device (e.g., brand, model, specifications, condition).
   - Users can upload photos of their device (optional).
   - The website will analyze the input and provide an estimated price using:
     a. **Historical Data Pricing**: Scrape historical price data from platforms like eBay, Amazon, and local marketplaces.
     b. **AI-Based Pricing**: Use machine learning models to predict prices based on product specifications and condition.
     c. **Demand & Supply Pricing**: Analyze search trends and product availability to adjust the price.
     d. **Geographic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on the user's location (country/region).

2. **Additional Features**:
   - After providing the estimated price, the website will suggest alternative or upgraded products (with affiliate links) that the user might be interested in purchasing.
   - Users can click on the suggested products to buy them, and the website will earn affiliate commissions.

3. **Data Sources**:
   - Use APIs or web scraping to collect data from:
     - eBay, Amazon, and other e-commerce platforms.
     - Google Trends for demand analysis.
     - Local marketplaces for region-specific pricing.

4. **Design & Interface**:
   - Create a clean, user-friendly interface with:
     - A form for users to enter device details (brand, model, specifications, condition).
     - An option to upload photos of the device.
     - A "Get Price" button to generate the estimated price.
     - A results page displaying:
       - The estimated price.
       - Suggested alternative/upgraded products with affiliate links.
     - A simple navigation menu (Home, About, Contact).

5. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Use Python for backend logic (data scraping, AI models, pricing algorithms).
   - Use Flask or Django for the backend framework.
   - Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
   - Use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping.
   - Use TensorFlow or Scikit-learn for AI-based pricing.
   - Use a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store user inputs and product data.

6. **Monetization**:
   - Earn revenue through affiliate marketing (e.g., Amazon Associates, eBay Partner Network).

7. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test the website with sample data to ensure accurate pricing and smooth functionality.
   - Deploy the website using a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Replit.

**Task for the AI**:
- Generate the code for the website based on the above requirements.
- Provide a step-by-step guide to implement the pricing mechanism and features.
- Suggest improvements or additional features to enhance the website's functionality and user experience.
