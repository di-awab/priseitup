I want to build a simple, single-page website for pricing electronics devices. The website will allow users to estimate the price of their device based on its description and uploaded photos. Here are the requirements:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Users can enter a description of their device (e.g., "iPhone 13, 128GB, brand new, unlocked").
   - Users can upload photos of their device (optional).
   - The website will analyze the description using a free AI tool (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) to extract key details (e.g., brand, model, specifications, condition).
   - The website will use **Scrapy** to scrape real-time prices from popular platforms like eBay, Amazon, and local marketplaces based on the extracted details.
   - The website will display the estimated price prominently on the same page.

2. **Additional Features**:
   - After displaying the estimated price, the website will suggest alternative or upgraded products from Amazon using affiliate links.
   - Users can click on the suggested products to buy them, and the website will earn affiliate commissions.

3. **Data Sources**:
   - Use **Scrapy** to scrape real-time prices from:
     - eBay, Amazon, and other e-commerce platforms.
   - Use a free AI tool (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) to analyze the user's description and extract key details.

4. **Design & Interface**:
   - Create a clean, single-page interface with:
     - A text input field for the user to enter the device description.
     - A file upload button for users to upload photos (optional).
     - A "Get Price" button to generate the estimated price.
     - A section to display the estimated price prominently.
     - A section at the bottom to display suggested products from Amazon with affiliate links.
   - The design should be simple, modern, and mobile-friendly.

5. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Use **Python** for backend logic (AI analysis, Scrapy scraping).
   - Use **Flask** for the backend framework.
   - Use **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend.
   - Use **Scrapy** for web scraping.
   - Use a free AI tool like **Hugging Face Transformers** for text analysis.

6. **Monetization**:
   - Earn revenue through affiliate marketing (e.g., Amazon Associates).

7. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test the website with sample data to ensure accurate pricing and smooth functionality.
   - Deploy the website using a cloud platform like **Heroku** or **Render**.

**Task for the AI**:
- Generate the code for the website based on the above requirements.
- Provide a step-by-step guide to implement the pricing mechanism and features.
- Suggest improvements or additional features to enhance the website's functionality and user experience.
